# Context

 *From Wiki*

> "Credit card fraud is an inclusive term for fraud committed using a payment card, such as a credit card or debit card.[1] The purpose may be to obtain goods or services, or to make payment to another account which is controlled by a criminal."

Fraud committed using a payment card is considered a major problem for credit card companies.

It is a problem that keeps on growing without a foreseeable solution.

*From merchant-savvy*

> "Global losses from payment fraud ***have tripled*** from $9.84 Billion in 2011 to $32.39 in 2020. 
Payment fraud is ***expected to continue increasing*** and projected to cost $40.62 billion in 2027 – 25% higher than in 2020."

That is why It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

# The Data

This project is a part of a Kaggle competition and the data was generated by actual transactions from an anonymous credit card company.

The datasets contain transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.

The data contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, the company could not provide the original features and more background information about the data. 

That is why the Features are encoded as V1, V2, … V28, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. 

# Task

For this project Ill build a model that can detect fraudulent transactions.

Ill build the model in two ways and compare them.

The first approach will be to detect fraudulent transactions as a Classification problem.

The second approach will be to detect fraudulent transactions as an Anomaly Detection problem.
